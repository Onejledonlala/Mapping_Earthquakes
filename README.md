# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to show to Basil and Sadhana the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, to show the data on a third map.

### Result
The eathquake map was constructed from different url sources. i.e. https://geojson.org, https://leafletjs.com/index.html, https://earthquake.usgs.gov/... Libraries like D3.json, geoJSON were used to call the data, which was arranged to show magnitude and location of earthquakes. Markers and layers were added to visualize the relation of tectonic plates on the earth.

### Conclusion
Below is the overview of the map created as requested by Basil and Sadhana to visualize the magnitude of earthquakes.
